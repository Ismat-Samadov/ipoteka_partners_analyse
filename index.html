Their existing solution was built on spreadsheets and emails.I quickly learned more about this real problem--pay anxiety. These salespeople knocked doors 10+ hours a day, being paid commission-only. Many were students, looking to save for a car, tuition or a wedding. Not knowing their pay in real-time was terrifying.I built a simple demo with no-code tools. The aha moment came when my friend's bosses asked me \"what is your company called, and how much does it cost?\"At the time, I was full-time at my second struggling AI startup. This was pre-chatGPT, but I was already burning out from the hype. It was refreshing to hear someone tell me that they'd pay for a \"boring\", simple software solution.A few more meetings with people in the industry confirmed to me that this pain was universal and that the market was hungry for a solution.",
        "how_they_built_it":"Here's the exact timeline of that first year in...Here's the exact timeline of that first year in business2022\nOctober -> Built the no-code prototype, was asked how much it would cost\nNovember -> Started writing a mobile app when I kept hearing that's what they wanted\nDecember -> Quit my job to go full-time (at zero revenue)\nJanuary - March -> Fumbling around first attempts at sales and trying to close my first deal. Finished the app.\nApril -> Signed my first contract \nMay -> Signed second customer\nJune - August -> Lot's of bug-fixing and customer support through the first sales season\nAugust -> Joined a startup accelerator programI built the initial prototype on Retool. It cost me nothing, since I applied for startup credits and got them. I believe they even have a generous free tier now.When I started to rewrite it into a native app, my only cost was the domain ($12), google workspace ($6 / month) and supabase ($25 / month). I have never exceeded the free tiers of Vercel or Expo Application Services.I did and continue to design, code and sell every single inch of this business myself. It's not a flex, it's just what it took to make this company work. I don't think I would have succeeded if I took on any headcount burn. I didn't raise or borrow any money.(Heading) The Revenue Model:We've gone through lots of different models and are still iterating. But recent contracts have looked something like this:A seat-based contract, with \"standard\" and \"flex\" licenses.Standard license -> $10 ~ $30 / month, committed for at least 12 months\nFlex licenses -> 2x the price of Standard, month-to-month contract \nFlex licenses cannot make up more than 30% of the total seatsThis pricing model has come out of a need to balance predictable revenue and the seasonality of users in the industry. Since salespeople are typically active for up to half of the year, it's hard for clients to justify paying for the full year.",
        "how_they_grew":"Since I have a tiny, specific niche, the number...Since I have a tiny, specific niche, the number of clients that fit my ICP is numbered in the hundreds. This too small an amount to run any effective performance marketing on or to just \"dial\" from a list on.Instead every potential lead is treated more like a dedicated, long-term business development effort.New customers are shiny and exciting. But for us, a surprising amount of revenue actually comes from upselling existing clients into larger contracts. Once trust is built, we've found that customers shift quickly away from getting the best price to begging us to solve as many problems as possible. Each of these conversations are an opportunity to increase the scope, and therefore the price of the contract.The key to our success has been world-class account management and support. I drop everything to tend to a customer complaint, or request. I'm available at all hours of the day. My personal phone number is proudly plastered all over the app for direct help.",

        "idea_origin_story":"Pat Walls came up with the idea for Starter Sto...Pat Walls came up with the idea for Starter Story during a period of transition and reflection. After moving to a new city and experiencing the failure of a previous startup, he found himself longing to start his own business, but without co-founders or a clear direction. Inspired by reading stories from Indie Hackers and creators like Pieter Levels, Pat began to see the potential in starting an \"indie\" business by himself.My imageHe was motivated by the idea of working for himself and the freedom it would bring. While exploring different ideas, he noticed a lack of resources that consolidated real stories from entrepreneurs. This observation led him to create Starter Story, a platform where founders could share their journeys, complete with financial details. Pat validated his idea by testing how people responded to early interviews and refined his approach to align with his growing understanding of what potential entrepreneurs found valuable.A key challenge was maintaining focus and motivation, especially post-launch, as Pat faced personal hurdles and health issues in his family. However, he learned the importance of discipline and eventually established productive habits that fueled his progress. One pivotal lesson Pat took away was that initial setbacks or lack of resources shouldn't deter seriousness in pursuing a genuinely impactful idea.",
        "how_they_built_it":"Pat Walls built Starter Story by initially focu...Pat Walls built Starter Story by initially focusing on grassroots content creation and experimentation. He spent his early days developing lean processes, using tools like Ruby on Rails to automate and manage the blog’s backend. This allowed him to balance between the technical and content production sides effectively. During the initial phase, he worked tirelessly post-day-job hours to create engaging, text-based interviews, ensuring each story was detailed with revenue numbers and unique business insights. The first version of Starter Story came together rapidly, with the website launching just a few months after its conception.Walls faced significant challenges, especially in marketing and achieving visibility amidst the digital noise. He conquered these hurdles by leveraging platforms like Reddit and Product Hunt for exposure and adopting a build-in-public transparency that attracted an engaged audience. Through persistent testing and SEO optimization, he scaled Starter Story's traffic to over 1.6 million visitors per month and reached a revenue of over $1 million annually by 2023. Despite early skepticism and operational difficulties, Walls utilized a lean SEO framework and continuous content iteration to refine and perfect Starter Story’s value proposition.",
        "how_they_grew":"#### Reddit\n\nReddit played a crucial role in ...RedditReddit played a crucial role in Starter Story's growth, especially in the early stages. Pat Walls effectively leveraged the platform by sharing content in relevant subreddits like r/Entrepreneur. For instance, he shared interviews formatted in a Reddit-friendly way, which meant cutting down on too much self-promotion and ensuring the content was valuable for the community. This strategy led to several features on the subreddit, drastically increasing traffic to the website.Why it worked: Reddit is a community-driven platform where authentic content can flourish. By providing genuine, valuable content without heavily promoting his brand, Pat was able to earn the trust and engagement of Reddit users. This resulted in bursts of traffic and a growing email list, supplying Starter Story with a foundational audience base.SEOInitially, SEO was not the primary focus for Starter Story. However, Pat soon realized its potential and developed a 'Lean SEO' approach. This involved creating Minimum Viable Content (MVC) to test which topics would rank before investing heavily in content development. Once an article gained traction, it would be further optimized and expanded, leveraging keyword insights obtained post-publication.Why it worked: This agile approach to SEO enabled Starter Story to quickly identify and capitalize on content opportunities without excessive upfront investment. It allowed Pat to effectively scale content creation efforts, contributing to a significant increase in organic traffic, reaching over 1.6 million monthly visitors.Sponsorships & AdsSponsorships, particularly from Klaviyo, have been a successful revenue stream for Starter Story. Early success came when Klaviyo sponsored the website and newsletter for a sizable fee annually. This not only provided financial backing but validated the website's market position to other potential sponsors.Why it worked: High-value sponsorships provide a stable revenue source and increase the brand's credibility. The consistent sponsorship from a notable company like Klaviyo signals confidence in the product to other potential advertisers and partners, creating a virtuous cycle of interest and revenue.Building in PublicPat Walls has been a pioneer in building Starter Story in public, sharing his successes, failures, and insights openly with his audience. This transparency has fostered a sense of community and accountability and drawn interest from other entrepreneurs and thought leaders.Why it worked: Building in public cultivates a loyal following that feels personally invested in the journey. It also creates networking opportunities and attracts more founders who are eager to share their stories, further enriching the platform's content offering and broadening its appeal.",

They began by brainstorming and registering the ZenmasterWellness.com domain. The initial setup involved purchasing a GeneratePress site template and Elementor Pro page builder, with hosting provided by Siteground. Despite limited experience in web development, the founder used numerous YouTube tutorials and relied on GeneratePress's support to navigate the technical aspects, iteratively assembling a site that was 'good enough' to publish.The first prototype was a basic WordPress site using an off-the-shelf template and a custom header image (originally an unrelated drone photo), with minimal custom design work except for a logo from Fiverr (later replaced by a licensed font). The development process was slow and inefficient at first, due to the founder's lack of web development experience, with learning curves especially around the WordPress platform. Major tools included WordPress, GeneratePress, Elementor Pro, Figma for design, and Google properties (Analytics, Search Console, Drive) for site management. The process from domain registration to a working site took several weeks of solo work, with repeated adjustments to site structure and design. Key challenges included frustration with WordPress, dissatisfaction with early branding/logo work, and the long, often overwhelming learning process of content site creation while managing numerous other startup tasks simultaneously.",
